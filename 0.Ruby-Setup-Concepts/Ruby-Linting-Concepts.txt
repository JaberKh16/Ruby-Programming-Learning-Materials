Ruby Linking (File Linking / Requiring)

In Ruby, linking refers to connecting multiple files together so that
classes, modules, and methods defined in one file can be used in another.

Common ways to link files:
1. require
   - Loads the file only once
   - Used for gems and standard libraries

   Example:
     require 'json'

2. require_relative
   - Loads a file relative to the current file
   - Most commonly used in raw Ruby projects

   Example:
     require_relative '../lib/user'

3. load
   - Loads the file every time it is called
   - Rarely used in production

   Example:
     load 'config.rb'

Best Practice:
- Use require_relative for project files
- Use require for gems and Ruby standard libraries

Rubocop (Ruby Code Linter & Formatter)

RuboCop is a static code analyzer and formatter for Ruby.
It enforces Ruby style guidelines and helps maintain clean,
consistent, and readable code.

Key Concepts:
- Cops: Individual rules that check code style and best practices
- Auto-correct: Automatically fixes many offenses
- Configuration: Controlled via .rubocop.yml

Basic Commands:
  rubocop          # Analyze code
  rubocop -A       # Auto-correct all safe issues
  rubocop -a       # Auto-correct safe issues only

Example .rubocop.yml:
  AllCops:
    NewCops: enable
    TargetRubyVersion: 3.2

Benefits:
- Improves code quality
- Enforces team-wide standards
- Reduces code review time
- Encourages Ruby best practices
